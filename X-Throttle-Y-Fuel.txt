An engine control unit (ECU) controls the operation of a car engine.
It reads from the pedal sensor in order to detect how much throttle should be applied.

The value of X-Throttle is an integer in the range 0 to 255.
Based on the throttle value, the ECU send the fuel injection controller the amount of fuel
that needs to be injected into the engine (Y-Fuel is an integer ranging between 0 to 765).

Y-Fuel is calculated by the following procedure:
If X-Throttle is less than or equal to 127, then Y-Fuel = X-THROTTLE * 2
If X-Throttle is greater than 127, then Y-Fuel = X-THROTTLE + 130

The ECU also reads the sensor that measures the tomperature of the engine.
If the engine is still cool, previous rules are disregarced and the ECU just
forwards three times the reading from the pedal sensor, ie., Y-Fuel = X-THROTTLE * 3.

Write the optimal (effective and efficient) set of boundary test cases to test the fuel injection function.
