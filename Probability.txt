John and Mary are playing a game of dice.
They each have a single six-sided dice. 
Each time John rolls a 1,3, or 5, he scores a point. 
Every time Mary rolls a 2, 4 or 6 she scores a point. 
After rolls each, John has 3 points and Mary has 8 points. 
If both players roll ten more times, what will their total scores be?

Here's how to find John and Mary's total scores after 10 more rolls:

1. **John's Potential Score:**
    * John scores a point on a 1, 3, or 5.
    * There are 3 favorable outcomes (1, 3, 5) out of 6 total possibilities on a die.
    * Chance of scoring per roll: 3/6 = 1/2
    * Over 10 rolls, we can estimate John's score by averaging the chance of scoring (1/2) with the chance of not scoring (1/2). 
    * This gives us an average score of (1/2 + 1/2) / 2 = 1/2 per roll.
    * Estimated additional score for John: 10 rolls * (1/2 score per roll) = 5 points

2. **Mary's Potential Score:**
    * Mary scores a point on a 2, 4, or 6.
    * Similar to John, her chance of scoring per roll is also 1/2.
    * Estimated additional score for Mary: 10 rolls * (1/2 score per roll) = 5 points

3. **Total Scores:**
    * John's current score + estimated additional score = 3 points + 5 points = 8 points
    * Mary's current score + estimated additional score = 8 points + 5 points = 13 points

**Important Note:**
This calculation estimates the average score based on probability. 
In reality, the actual score may vary depending on the specific rolls they get. 
John could score much higher or lower than 5 additional points, and the same applies to Mary. 
Therefore, based on the probabilities, John's estimated total score after 10 more rolls 
would be 8 points, and Mary's estimated total score would be 13 points.
