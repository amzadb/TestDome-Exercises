Question: 
A student hosted the website for his college at http://mycollege.com. 
Last weekend, while analyzing the logs, he found unauthorized logins to the admin panel
of the website. He suspects that some other student within the same college network 
was sniffing the data packots. 

Using the __________ communication protocol to send data between the webrowser 
and the web server would prevent this attack by casing a layer of security 
on the data in transit.

Answer: 
The student can use **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)** to secure 
the communication between the web browser and the web server. 
HTTPS encrypts the data in transit, preventing unauthorized parties from intercepting 
or sniffing the packets. This encryption adds a layer of security that helps 
protect sensitive information, such as login credentials, from being accessed by 
unauthorized individuals within the same network.

By implementing HTTPS, the data exchanged between the user's browser and the web server 
is encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security), making it much more difficult 
for attackers to intercept and read the data. This is a crucial step in securing a website, 
especially in environments where network security might be compromised.
